# Project: Automated ETL/ELT Pipeline & Decision Suite 🚀

**The Problem:** An SMB client was losing ~12 hours per week to manual data consolidation across fragmented platforms, leading to delayed reporting and "gut-feeling" decision making.

**The Solution:** I engineered a custom ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that synchronizes disparate data sources into a centralized SQL environment, powering a real-time Power BI Decision Engine.

### 💰 Business Impact
* **Time Savings:** Automated 100% of the weekly data preparation cycle, reclaiming 45+ hours of staff time per month.
* **Data Integrity:** Eliminated human entry errors by implementing automated Python-based validation logic.
* **Agility:** Reduced "Time-to-Insight" from 7 days to < 10 minutes.

### 🧩 System Architecture

1.  **Extraction:** Python scripts connect to disparate APIs and CSV silos.
2.  **Transformation:** Data is cleaned and normalized using Pandas and R to ensure MBA-level logic consistency.
3.  **Loading:** Secure delivery into a cloud-hosted SQL database.
4.  **Visualization:** Real-time Power BI dashboards for executive-level oversight.

### 🚀 Implementation Highlights
* **Strategic Mapping:** Performed a non-invasive audit to identify logic gaps before writing a single line of code.
* **Scalable Infrastructure:** Built to grow with the business without requiring additional licensing overhead.
* **Prescriptive Intelligence:** Included "What-If" parameters in the dashboard to simulate future business scenarios.
